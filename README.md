# zookeepr
The local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked me to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server I create. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.
